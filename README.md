# Planar Graphs for C#

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/PlanarGraphs.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PlanarGraphs)

## Overview

C# implementation of the Boyer-Myrvold algorithm for planarity testing. algorithm only supports undirected planar graphs. Ported from the C++ Boost library.

**Note**: This started as a fork of [OndrejNepozitek's](https://github.com/OndrejNepozitek/GraphPlanarityTesting) port. Credit to Ondrej for porting this from the official Boost C++ Planar Graph library to C#. For my project, I needed Edges to support custom data, e.g. weight, as well as other features, hence the fork.
